Five Step Coding Workflow

2D Sprite Animation Sheet

1: Tool Description

	- Goal: Create a script that will animate a 2d sprite sheet
	- Funtionality: Have control of speed for the animation, frames and placement
	- Tool side: Accessible through the inspector
	- Support for the diffuse, spec and normal maps
	- Tile sheet support for level editing
	- Support for individual character pieces
	- etc

2: Research

	- List of topics to research
		- 2d sprite textures
		- 2d array
		- x, y coordenates
		- u, v coordenates
		- speed/fps
		- offseting to move u,v
		- Time
		- Variables & types
		- Functions
		- Materials & textures types or maps
		- Words I don't know

3: Instruction Manual

	1.	Take a texture and assign it to a material
	2.	Assign the material to a plane (gameObject)
	3.	Assign script (animation) our plane and with that provide the options in the inspector
	4.	Input the size of the sprite sheet (width and height)
	5.	Input start frame location (row and column)
	6.	Input the length of the animation (how many frames)
	7.	Input the speed of the animation (frames per second)

4: Pseudocode (Structured English Style)
	
	need to have a constantly updated script to provide the motion for the animation
	we need to offset for the uv's sideways to a controlled speed (frames per second)
	then have the ability to 'scale/zoom in' to a specific size on the poly
	space in 2 dimensions
	be able to choose the frame length (clip length)
	make it a function and be able to call it up in other scripts

	get the offset of the uv's and move them based on time
	figure out how to find the end of the frame...
	if at end, then go back to the beginning of the image
	get column and row frame amount...
	then find the size of the frame (just one frame)
	create a way to offset the uv's based on the size of a frame and the image
	render the texture to the poly at the new offset (uv) location
	render the texture to the correct size (scale)

	variables - columnSize, rowSize, framesPerSecond, columnFrameStart, rowFrameStart, totalFrames
	

5: Write the code
